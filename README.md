**Welcome to Bamazon!** 

In this activity, I have created an Amazon-like storefront with MySQL skills. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can switch over to Manager mode and program the app to track inventory, by adding additional quantities or adding new products. 

*bamazonCustomer.js<br>
*bamazonManager.js<br>

Since this is a command line app, be sure to clone the repo and run ```npm install``` and ```mysql-ctl start```
